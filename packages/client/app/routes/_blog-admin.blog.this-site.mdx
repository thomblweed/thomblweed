I've been working on this site intermittently for months, utilizing various approaches and tools as opportunities to explore interesting technologies. However, I found myself changing my mind several times throughout the process and eventually circled back to the <a href="https://remix.run/" target="_blank">Remix</a> framework.

### Remix

I remember watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dOAFJUOi-s" target="_blank">this video</a> for Remix beta v1 some years ago and I was genuinely excited by the approaches
demonstrated. In particular, the handling of <a href="https://remix.run/docs/en/main/components/form" target="_blank">forms</a> in Remix with a server action. As I initially needed a login form for this site, I decided this was a good excuse to use Remix and then I just found I enjoyed the developer experiance so much and so stuck with it. The login form has since become obsolete for the time being, but you can view it <Link to="/login">here</Link>.

The intial idea was to create a blog site I could add and edit content on the site directly like a cms. After some time I decided I would utilise mdx instead for the time being as Remix has such <a href='https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite#add-mdx-plugin' target='_blank'>great support</a> for this expecially now I have gone down the route of adding <a href='https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite' target='_blank'>Vite</a> to the mix.

### SST

Deploying Remix to AWS is so great with <a href='https://sst.dev/' target='_blank'>SST</a>.
